# GreenMaps Map API
This project is a REST API to serve data to the mobile Xamarin app. The API is written in C# ASP&#46;NET Core with connections to an Azure SQL database to store and retrieve data using Entity Framework Core.

The API is automatically deployed to a Serverless Azure Web App instance upon merging into the main branch.
